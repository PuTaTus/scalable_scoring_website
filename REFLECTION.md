TODO: There is a brief description of the application in REFLECTION.md that highlights the key design decisions for the application. The document also contains a reflection of possible improvements that should be done to improve the performance of the application.

I built the site for approximately 1 week. There are alot of design choices that I did, such as having components to make the app easier to manage, having a svelte store to have a "Global variable" that can share through all of the apps, api end points with request handler, and most importantly the queue in the grader-api. The queue is the most tricky design decision that I have to make, as it involves new concept such as short pooling and requires me to get stuck for 3 days trying to get the correct implementation. For reflections, I think I could've implemented web sockets, but I don't have that much time to do so. The documentation could be improved and alert could be replaced to something more concrete, like a component.
